FT  14 MAY 91 / (CORRECTED) Jubilee of a jet that did what it was designed
to do
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 16th May 1991) appended to this article.
'FRANK, it flies]' shouted someone at Sir Frank Whittle during the maiden
flight of a British jet. 'Of course it does,' replied Sir Frank, who
patented the first aircraft gas turbine. 'That's what it was bloody well
designed to do, wasn't it?'
Exactly 50 years ago yesterday, the first British jet made a brief 17-minute
flight from RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire. To celebrate the event, Mr Eric
'Winkle' Brown, a 72-year-old test pilot of the prototype Gloster Whittle
jet, Mr Geoffrey Bone, a 73-year-old engineer, and Mr Charles McClure, a
75-year-old pilot, returned to RAF Cranwell. They are seen in front of a
restored Meteor NF 11. Sir Frank was unable to attend because of ill-health.
The Gloster Whittle was not the first jet to fly: a Heinkel 178 had its
maiden flight in August 1939, 21 months before the British aircraft.

THE PICTURE of a Gloster Whittle jet on Page 7 of the issue of Tuesday May
14, was taken at Bournemouth Airport and not at RAF Cranwell as stated in
the caption.

FT  14 MAY 91 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Geevor merger hits rocks over
pre-conditions
</HEADLINE>

Correction (published 16th May 1991) appended to this article.
Geevor, the UK mining group which has been fighting for survival since the
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce called in a Pounds 2.1m loan in
extraordinary circumstances in January, has suffered another set-back.
Its proposed merger with European Mining Finance, a Luxembourg-quoted
investment company, has run into problems and will not go ahead on the terms
announced in March.
Two of the pre-conditions for the merger have not been satisfied - the
raising of bank finance for the enlarged group and the termination of the
management agreement between EMF and its manager, Lion Mining Finance.
However, Geevor said it remained in talks with EMF and other parties 'which
may result in modified proposals'.
Monarch Resources, the UK-quoted mining group with operations in Venezuela,
has appointed Mr Anthony Ciali as president and chief executive officer.
This follows the recent boardroom shake-up which resulted in the departure
of seven directors and the arrival of Mr Michael Beckett as chairman.
Mr Beckett was managing director of Consolidated Gold Fields and Mr Ciali
was once a vice-president of Gold Fields Mining Corp, a US subsidiary.
Correction (published 16th May 1991).
Lion Mining Finance is not the manager of European Mining Finance as we
reported on May 14.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Drexel details settlement plan
</HEADLINE>

DREXEL Burnham Lambert, the US investment bank which filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection 15 months ago, yesterday revealed details of a complex
settlement plan.
Under the agreement, Drexel's estate will be split between creditors and
parties making claims against it under securities law.
The settlement plan comes after judicial pressure to avoid a lengthy,
litigious liquidation.
There are still hurdles but lawyers in the case suggest it could be over by
early 1992, leaving a small 20-person concern to handle Drexel's illiquid
assets.
Under the agreement, the estate - reckoned at more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds
1.15bn) - is divided so that:
Administrative costs of the bankruptcy will be paid first, followed by
Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m of secured claims and a further Dollars 150m
payment into the Securities and Exchange Commission's civil disgorgement
fund;
The next Dollars 1.3bn is split 85:15 between fixed creditors and securities
litigants;
The next Dollars 700m is split 60:40 between the same parties; Thereafter,
the split is 50:50.
About Dollars 300m-Dollars 400m of particularly illiquid assets will go into
a a new entity to be owned by a 'liquidating trust'. This seems likely to be
sold eventually.
Under the plan, all securities litigation against Drexel would cease and
some 200 Drexel employees - though not Mr Fred Joseph, the former chief
executive - would be released from any new litigation claims.
Drexel will also 'pool' its own legal actions with those of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation, which regulates the troubled thrift industry,
and certain securities litigants, in cases where there is a common
defendant. This joint effort could apply in claims against former Drexel
employees, in particular Mr Michael Milken, who headed the lucrative junk
bond operation.
Drexel will get 14 per cent of money collected from such litigation, up to
Dollars 400m.
Perhaps the biggest hurdle is the Internal Revenue Service, which has filed
a Dollars 5.3bn claim and is not included in the settlement plan. Unless a
deal can be struck with the IRS, the merits of this claim will be heard by
the courts next month. If they grant an award above a certain sum -
undisclosed - the settlement agreement could be aborted.
