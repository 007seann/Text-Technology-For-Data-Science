"FT  14 MAY 91 / International Company News: Apple Computer upgrades
Macintosh","APPLE Computer has intro- duced new software for its Macintosh personal
computers with which the company aims to counter competition from
Microsoft's popular Windows program and boost its share of the personal
computer market.
Apple's new System 7 is an enhanced version of the Macintosh operating
system, the program that controls the basic functions of a computer.
The new software 'raises the bar' in what customers will expect from a
personal computer, claimed Mr John Sculley, Apple chairman and chief
executive.
'Macintosh system software is Apple's greatest strength, and we intend to
use this advantage aggressively to become a much bigger player in the
industry,' he said.
'System 7 sets a new standard, thereby widening the gap between what one can
do with a computer, and what one can do with a Macintosh.'
The system includes a new graphical user interface that makes the Macintosh
easier to use, as well as features that enhance the Macintosh's ability to
perform several tasks simultaneously. New Macintosh buyers will get System 7
free with their computers. Most current Macintosh users, however, will have
to upgrade their computers to take advantage of the new software.
System 7 will be offered in the US for Dollars 99. Apple USA also announced
price cuts on the add-on processor and memory boards that will be needed to
upgrade older Macintosh models. The introduction of System 7 demonstrates
that 'Apple is on the offensive,' Mr Sculley claimed.
Many, however, view the software launch as a defensive move aimed at
Microsoft's Windows program which provides IBM-compatible personal computers
with many of the ease-of-use features of the Apple Macintosh.
Apple acknowledged that the introduction of System 7 was delayed for over a
year by technical difficulties.
Although existing Macintosh applications programs will run on System 7,
there are few new programs designed to take full advantage of the new
operating system, analysts noted.
